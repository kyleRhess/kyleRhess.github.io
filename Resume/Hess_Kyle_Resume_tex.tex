\subsubsection*{Dynetics Inc.\hspace{3 mm}|\hspace{3 mm}Electrical Engineer - Section Manager\hspace{3 mm}|\hspace{3 mm}10/2021 - Present}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{Reverse Engineering \& FME}}    
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Work with multiple small teams to reverse engineer and exploit mixed signal circuits and systems, 
    identify unknown components and understand the designs from low-level circuitry to the complete system
    \item Visually and electronically trace unknown circuits, draw their representative schematics, and analyze 
    the schematics to determine functionality
    \item Write technical sections for deliverable milestone reports that provide project status updates to customers 
    and other project contributors. Reports include threat system findings and testing methodologies
    \item Utilize some threat hardware designs to reproduce circuit boards for customer replacement hardware 
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{Hardware Design \& Testing}}    
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Create electrical schematics using Dx Designer and collaborate with the PCB layout team to produce 
    complete PCBA design packages for boards that incude digital, analog and RF signals up to 12 layers
    \item Produce system block diagrams and chassis cable assembly drawings in Visio for top-level integration
    \item Develop supporting hardware for our Hardware-In-The-Loop team to interface between simulation computers 
    and threat systems to close the simulation loop
    \item Conduct bench testing of remanufactured threat hardware and original designs to verify assumptions and simulation results
    \item Apply internal Agile PLM tools and processes to track the release of parts and drawings 
    as well as engineering change orders and deviations for controlling revisions of these items
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Worked with a small team to develop and debug firmware for IMUs and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)
    \item Collaborated with a contracted team of experts to write and integrate a new 15-state Extended Kalman Filter into a legacy INS/GPS design which resulted in a 10x improvement in "free-inertial" navigation performance
    \item Supported C++ Windows applications for production testing and calibration
    \item Created and managed electrical schematics, circuit board layouts, board revisions and BOMs with OrCAD
    \item Rewrote internal data processing tools using Python to replace cryptic Excel macros and support new products
    \item Supported customers with application engineering challenges during IMU integration (remotely and directly)
\end{itemize}
