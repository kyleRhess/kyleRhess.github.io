\section*{Professional Experience}

\subsubsection*{10/2021 - Present\hspace{3 mm}|\hspace{3 mm}Electrical Engineer II\hspace{3 mm}|\hspace{3 mm}Dynetics Inc.}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{Reverse Engineering \& FME}}    
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Work with multiple small teams to reverse engineer mixed signal circuit boards and systems, 
    identify unknown components and understand the designs from the low-level circuitry to the complete system
    \item Contribute to deliverable milestone reports that provide project status updates to customers 
    and other project contributors. Reports include threat system findings and testing methodologies.
    \item Utilize some threat hardware designs to reproduce circuit boards for customer replacement hardware 
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{Hardware Design \& Testing}}    
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Create electrical schematics using Dx Designer and collaborate with the PCB layout team to produce 
    complete PCBA design packages for boards that incude digital, analog and RF signals up to 12 layers
    \item Produce system block diagrams and chassis cable assembly drawings in Visio for top-level integration
    \item Develop supporting hardware with our HITL team to interface between simulation computers 
    and various threat systems to permit the inclusion of real threat hardware in simulation loops
    \item Conduct bench testing of threat hardware and original designs to verify assumptions and simulation results
    \item Apply internal Agile PLM tools and processes to track the release of parts and drawings 
    as well as engineering change orders and deviations for controlling revisions of these items
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Created and managed electrical schematics, circuit board layouts, board revisions and BOMs with OrCAD
    \item Worked with a small team to develop and debug firmware for IMUs and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)
    \item Collaborated with a contracted team of experts to write and integrate a new 15-state Extended Kalman Filter into a legacy INS/GPS design which resulted in a 10x improvement in "free-inertial" navigation performance
    \item Supported custom C++ Windows applications for production testing and calibration
    \item Rewrote our data processing system using Python to replace cryptic Excel macros and support new products
    \item Tracked all product development progress through phase-gates per AS9100D quality management system
    \item Managed prototype builds from system design to part procurement to final compliance testing  
    \item Supported customers with application engineering challenges during IMU integration (remotely and directly)
    \item Wrote and maintained product Datasheets, User Guides, Technical Summaries and Reference Manuals
\end{itemize}

\section*{Personal Projects}


\textbf{eBike Motor Driver (01/2022 - ongoing)}\newline
Efficient servo driver for a 3-phase brushless DC motor.
Utilizes phase current sensing and incremental encoder feedback to control the 3-phase currents for optimal rotor torque with space vector modulation.
Cascaded PID controllers allow for precise speed and position control with an encoder resolution of 0.26 mrad.\newline
This motor drive was then successfully used as the controller for a 1.5 kW eBike hub motor.
